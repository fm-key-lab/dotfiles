# Lab dotfiles

On a Unix-like OS, files or folders beginning with a dot character are commonly called **dotfiles**. Dotfiles are "hidden" from many filesystem commands and commonly used for storing user or application configurations.

`yadm` is [Yet Another Dotfiles Manager](https://yadm.io) that mostly behaves as a plug-in replacement for Git commands. The most important difference between `yadm` and Git is that `yadm` can only track a single repository: `$HOME`.

This repository holds the lab's configuration dotfiles and is meant to be used with `yadm`.

## Usage

The lab maintains an installation of `yadm`, available via environment module. To add the lab's configuration dotfiles to your `$HOME` directory:

```bash
module load yadm
# cd $HOME <- Not necessary: Will automatically act on $HOME.
yadm clone git@github.com:fm-key-lab/dotfiles.git
yadm status
```

## Handling file conflicts

### Overwrite

[Note](https://yadm.io/docs/getting_started) that:

> The clone command will attempt to check out all files that exist in the repository. If a file already exists locally and has content that differs from the one in the repository, the local file will be left unmodified and youâ€™ll have to review and resolve the differences.

To overwrite existing dotfiles with those from this repo:

```bash
yadm checkout "$HOME"
```

### Ignore

For many dotfiles, you will prefer to use your own versions:

> **How can I configure ignored files?**
> 
> By default, yadm is configured to ignore untracked files when displaying a status. This does not prevent you from adding untracked files. However, if you would like to prevent some files from being added accidentally, you can configure them to be ignored.
> 
> If you add a `.gitignore` file to your `$HOME` directory (or subdirectories) you can have those patterns ignored by yadm. This works exactly like it does for Git. Be sure to add these `.gitignore` files to your repo, so they can be synced along with your other configurations.
> 
> Another option is to add patterns to `$HOME/.local/share/yadm/repo.git/info/exclude`. If you use this file, be sure to add your patterns above any `yadm-auto-excludes` line, as all lines below this can be overwritten by yadm when encrypting data.

## Contributing

To contribute to the lab's configuration dotfiles:

```bash
yadm checkout -b <branch-name>
yadm add <contributions>
yadm commit -m <commit msg>
yadm push -u origin <branch-name>
```
