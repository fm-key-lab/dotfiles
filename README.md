# Lab dotfiles

On a Unix-like OS, files or folders beginning with a dot character are commonly called **dotfiles**. Dotfiles are "hidden" from many filesystem commands and commonly used for storing user or application configurations.

`yadm` is [Yet Another Dotfiles Manager](https://yadm.io) that mostly behaves as a plug-in replacement for Git commands. The most important difference between `yadm` and Git is that `yadm` can only track a single repository: `$HOME`.

This repository holds the lab's configuration dotfiles and is meant to be used with `yadm`.

## Usage

The lab maintains an installation of `yadm`, available via environment module. To add the lab's configuration dotfiles to your `$HOME` directory:

```bash
module load yadm
# cd $HOME <- Not necessary: Will automatically act on $HOME.
yadm clone git@github.com:fm-key-lab/dotfiles.git
yadm status
```

[Note](https://yadm.io/docs/getting_started) that:

> The clone command will attempt to check out all files that exist in the repository. If a file already exists locally and has content that differs from the one in the repository, the local file will be left unmodified and youâ€™ll have to review and resolve the differences.

To overwrite existing dotfiles with those from this repo:

```bash
yadm checkout "$HOME"
```

## Contributing

To contribute to the lab's configuration dotfiles:

```bash
yadm checkout -b <branch-name>
yadm add <contributions>
yadm commit -m <commit msg>
yadm push -u origin <branch-name>
```
